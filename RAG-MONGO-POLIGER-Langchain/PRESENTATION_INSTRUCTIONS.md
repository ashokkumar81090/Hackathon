- 500 analysts × 1,200 hours × $75 = $45M in time value
- Plus $1.8M from automation and $1.2M from improved resolution rates
- Total: $5.9M annual savings"

### Q: "What's the implementation risk?"
**A:** "Very low risk:
- Uses existing infrastructure (MongoDB, cloud services)
- 2-week pilot program allows testing before full commitment
- No vendor lock-in - multi-provider support
